# Authentication Convention

This section outlines the conventions and best practices for managing authentication flows within Harvide Starter.

## Overview

Harvide Starter provides a robust authentication system that is highly configurable via `starter.config.ts`. When extending or customizing authentication, adhere to the following principles:

*   **Centralized Configuration**: All authentication-related settings should primarily be managed through the `auth` object in `starter.config.ts`.
*   **Variant-Based UI**: Authentication UI components (login, signup) are designed to be variant-based. When creating new UI components for authentication, follow the variant pattern.
*   **Secure by Default**: Always prioritize security. Handle sensitive data (passwords, tokens) with care and ensure proper validation and encryption.

## Key Areas

*   **Login and Signup Forms**: Located in `apps/client/src/components/auth/login-form/variants/` and `apps/client/src/components/auth/signup-form/variants/`. New variants should extend the base `LoginFormProps` or `SignupFormProps`.
*   **Authentication Flows**: The core logic for handling authentication (login, signup, password reset, OTP verification) is encapsulated in dedicated flow functions.
*   **Social Providers**: Integration with OAuth providers is managed through `starter.config.ts` and requires corresponding environment variables.

## Customization

When customizing authentication flows or UI, consider:

*   **Extending, not Modifying**: Prefer extending existing components or flows rather than directly modifying core files, to simplify future updates.
*   **Type Safety**: Ensure all new components and configurations are type-safe and align with existing TypeScript definitions.
*   **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback for all authentication steps.
