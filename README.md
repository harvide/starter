*   **Authentication Behavior**: Enable/disable various authentication methods, set password policies, and manage account linking.
*   **UI Variants**: Choose different login and signup form implementations.
*   **Admin Panel Settings**: Configure impersonation, user banning, and dashboard metrics.
*   **Email Service**: Define email provider and sender details.

For a complete overview of all configurable options, please see the [Configuration Reference](/docs/configuration) in our documentation.
