# Login Forms

This section details the conventions for developing and extending login form components in Harvide Starter.

## Overview

Login forms are crucial for user authentication. Harvide Starter provides a flexible system for creating different login form variants, which can be configured via `starter.config.ts`.

## Structure

Login form components are located in `apps/client/src/components/auth/login-form/variants/`. Each file within this directory represents a different variant (e.g., `basic.tsx`).

Each variant should:

*   Be a React component.
*   Accept `LoginFormProps` as its props.
*   Handle various login flows (email/password, OTP, social) by utilizing the provided flow functions.
*   **Leverage Existing Flows**: It's highly recommended to reuse the authentication flow logic provided in `packages/ui/src/components/auth/login-form/flows.ts`. These functions abstract away the complex authentication interactions with the backend.
*   **Utilize Default Props**: The `LoginFormProps` interface defines common properties like `header`, `subtitle`, `callbackUrl`, etc. Use these props to ensure consistency and configurability of your variant.

## Adding a New Login Form Variant

To add a new login form variant, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new file**: For example, `packages/ui/src/components/auth/login-form/variants/my-custom-login.tsx`.
2.  **Implement your component**: Export a React component that takes `LoginFormProps`. You can use an existing variant like `basic.tsx` as a starting point.
3.  **Register the variant**: Update the `LoginFormVariants` map in `packages/ui/src/components/auth/login-form/index.ts` to include your new component.
4.  **Configure in `starter.config.ts`**: Set `ui.loginForm` in your `starter.config.ts` to the name of your new variant.
