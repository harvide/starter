# Setup

This section guides you through setting up your development environment for Harvide Starter.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **Git**: For version control. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
*   **Bun** (recommended package manager): Install Bun by running:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
    ```
    Alternatively, you can use:
    *   **npm** (comes with Node.js)
    *   **pnpm**: `npm install -g pnpm`
    *   **yarn**: `npm install -g yarn`
*   **Docker** (Optional, for database setup): If you plan to use a local PostgreSQL database, Docker will simplify the setup. Download from [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

## Recommended Tools

*   **VS Code**: A popular code editor with excellent TypeScript and React support.
    *   [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   Recommended extensions: ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense.
*   **Harvide Starter CLI**: The `create-harvide-starter` CLI tool is used to scaffold new projects. It will be installed automatically when you run `bunx create-harvide-starter` (or `npx` / `pnpm dlx` / `yarn dlx`).

## Database Setup

Harvide Starter uses Drizzle ORM and supports PostgreSQL by default.

### Local PostgreSQL with Docker

If you have Docker installed, you can quickly set up a local PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
docker run --name harvide-db -e POSTGRES_USER=user -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=database -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
```

This command will:
*   Run a PostgreSQL container named `harvide-db`.
*   Set up a user, password, and database.
*   Map port `5432` from the container to your local machine.

You can then connect to this database using the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
`DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database"`

### Database Migrations

After setting up your database, you'll need to run migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
bun run db:migrate
```
(Replace `bun run` with your chosen package manager's run command if different).

## Environment Variables

Harvide Starter relies on environment variables for sensitive information and configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on the `.env.example` file.

```dotenv
# .env example content
# PostgreSQL database connection string
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database"
# Frontend URL, used for redirects, CORS and email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000"
# Generate a secret using `openssl rand -base64 32`
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_strong_auth_secret_key"

# Mail
# You should only set one of the following options and choose proper provider in `starter.config.ts`

# SMTP configuration for sending emails
# SMTP_ADAPTER=
# SMTP_HOST=
# SMTP_PORT=
# SMTP_USER=
# SMTP_PASSWORD=

# Resend API Key (for Resend provider)
# RESEND_API_KEY=
```

**Important Notes for Mail Configuration:**

*   **Choose a Provider**: In your `starter.config.ts` file, you specify which email provider to use (`"resend"`, `"mailgun"`, or `"smtp"`). Make sure the corresponding environment variables in your `.env` file are configured.
*   **Required for Flows**: If you enable features like email verification (`auth.emailAndPassword.requireEmailVerification`), password reset (`auth.emailAndPassword.sendResetPassword`), or email OTP (`auth.emailAndPassword.otp.enabled`), you **must** configure a mail provider in your `.env` file and enable email services in `starter.config.ts`.
*   **`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL`**: This variable is crucial for generating correct links in emails (e.g., verification links, password reset links) as it's used for redirects and email link generation. Ensure it's set to your application's public URL.

Ensure your `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` is a strong, randomly generated string for security.

Once your environment is set up, you're ready to start developing with Harvide Starter!
