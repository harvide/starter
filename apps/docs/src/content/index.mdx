# Welcome to @harvide/starter

**Never handle authentication flows, user management, or email notifications manually again.**

`@harvide/starter` is a production-ready, highly customizable boilerplate for your next application. It comes with pre-configured authentication, UI components, and a set of best practices to help you ship faster.

Whether you're building a simple side project or a full-fledged SaaS application, `@harvide/starter` provides the foundation you need to focus on what matters most: your product.

## Core Concepts

- **Customizable Flows**: Most of the application's behavior can be configured through a single `starter.config.ts` file. No need to dig through the codebase to make changes.
- **Extensible by Design**: Built with modularity in mind, you can easily add new features, pages, and components.
- **Developer Experience**: We care about DX. Enjoy a modern stack with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a powerful CLI to get you started in minutes.
