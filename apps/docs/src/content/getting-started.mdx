# Getting Started

The best way to start with `@harvide/starter` is by using the official CLI tool, `create-harvide-starter`. This will scaffold a new project for you with all the necessary files and configurations.

<Steps>
### Run the CLI

Open your terminal and run the following command. You can use your preferred package manager.

```bash
npx create-harvide-starter
```

### Project Setup

The CLI will guide you through a series of questions to configure your new project:

1.  **Project Name**: The name of your application.
2.  **Description**: A brief description of your project.
3.  **Package Manager**: Choose between `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, and `bun`.
4.  **Features**: Select the features you want to include:
    - `Web Application` (Next.js)
    - `Admin Panel` (Next.js)
5.  **Authentication Methods**: If you selected the Web Application, you can choose your authentication methods:
    - `Email/Password`
    - `Phone Number`
    - `Social Providers` (Google, GitHub, etc.)

### Start the Development Server

Once the installation is complete, navigate to your new project directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm run dev
```

Your application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

</Steps>

That's it! You now have a fully functional application with authentication and UI components ready to go.
