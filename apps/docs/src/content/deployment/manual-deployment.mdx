# Manual Deployment

This guide outlines the steps for manually deploying your Harvide Starter application to a custom server or environment.

## Prerequisites

*   A server with Node.js (v18.x or later) and Git installed.
*   A running PostgreSQL database.
*   SSH access to your server.

## Steps

1.  **Clone your repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    bun install --production
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file on your server. Ensure all necessary environment variables are set, including `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, and any mail service credentials.

4.  **Run Database Migrations**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:migrate
    ```

5.  **Build the application**:
    ```bash
    bun run build
    ```

6.  **Start the application**:
    You can use a process manager like PM2 or Systemd to keep your application running.
    ```bash
    bun run start
    ```
    Or with PM2:
    ```bash
    pm2 start "bun run start" --name "harvide-starter-app"
    ```

Ensure your server's firewall rules allow access to your application's port (default 3000). You might also want to set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache for proper domain handling and SSL.
