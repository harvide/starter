# Email Verification Templates

This section outlines the conventions for developing and extending email verification templates in Harvide Starter.

## Overview

Email verification is a critical part of the authentication process, ensuring user emails are valid. Harvide Starter provides a system for creating different email template variants, which can be configured.

## Structure

Email verification templates are located in `packages/mail/src/transactional/emails/email-verification/variants/`. Each file within this directory represents a different variant (e.g., `basic.tsx`).

Each variant should:

*   Be a React component that renders HTML.
*   Accept `EmailVerificationProps` as its props.
*   Utilize the `EmailBase` component for consistent styling and branding.

## Adding a New Email Verification Template Variant

To add a new email verification template variant, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new file**: For example, `packages/mail/src/transactional/emails/email-verification/variants/my-custom-template.tsx`.
2.  **Implement your component**: Export a React component that takes `EmailVerificationProps` and renders the email HTML. You can use an existing variant like `basic.tsx` as a starting point.
3.  **Register the variant**: Update the relevant registration mechanism (e.g., a map or enum) that `starter.config.ts` uses to select email templates.
4.  **Configure in `starter.config.ts`**: Set the appropriate email template configuration in your `starter.config.ts` to the name of your new variant.

For more detailed instructions on adding new variants, refer to the [Adding New Variants](/adding-new-variants) documentation.
