# Deployment Overview

This section provides an overview of deploying your Harvide Starter application to various environments and platforms.

Harvide Starter applications are standard Next.js applications, which means they can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js applications, such as Vercel, Netlify, or a custom server. The application also includes a Drizzle ORM for database interactions, typically with PostgreSQL.

## Key Considerations

*   **Environment Variables**: Ensure all necessary environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, mail provider keys) are correctly configured in your deployment environment.
*   **Database Migrations**: Run database migrations on your production database before deploying your application updates.
*   **Mail Service**: If you're using email verification, password resets, or other email-dependent features, ensure your chosen mail provider is correctly configured and its API keys are set.
