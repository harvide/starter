# Next Steps

This section guides you through setting up your development environment for Harvide Starter.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or later ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))
*   **Git**: For version control ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/))
*   **Package Manager**: Choose one:
    ```bash
    # Bun (recommended)
    curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

    # pnpm
    npm install -g pnpm

    # yarn
    npm install -g yarn
    ```

## Database Setup

Harvide Starter uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. After setting up your database, run migrations from the project root:

```bash
bun run db:migrate # or npm/yarn/pnpm
```

## Environment Variables

Edit the `.env` file in your project root with your configuration:

```dotenv
# Required: Database connection
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/database"

# Required: Application URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Required: Auth secret (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET="your_strong_auth_secret_key"

# Email Provider (choose one)
# Resend:
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key

# SMTP:
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_username

```

For detailed email configuration and additional settings, see the [Email Service](/docs/authentication-email) guide.

## Development Server
